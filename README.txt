This designed project is a typing game which generates logic using DE2 board, takes in keyboard signals as input, and display corresponding images on a VGA monitor as outputs.
In this game, the main character, a cyan squid, is running away from the Pacman, the monster.
In order for the squid to run forward, the player has to type in the character that is displayed on the screen.
Every time the player types in the correct character, the program generates a new random alphabet letter, and replaces the old character with.
The speed of the squid is never constant, the faster the player types, the faster the squid runs away from the Pacman.
The squid dies either when it is caught by the Pacman or it runs out of energy (a time limit of 80 seconds), or it survived by successfully run away from the Pacman (reaches the right end of the screen).
